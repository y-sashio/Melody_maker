This repo contains a Python script for generating melodies using a Raspberry Pi and Piezo buzzer. This is an initial exploration into music generation with Python and hardware components. While it is fairly basic, there are many potential applications for this in music, gaming, and other fields. Enjoy exploring and extending this code!
